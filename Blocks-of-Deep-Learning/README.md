# Building Blocks of Deep Learning for Time Series Data

Deeper understanding of the common architectural blocks that are used for time series forecasting:
  - Encoder-decoder paradigm
  - Feed-forward neural networks
  - Recurrent neural networks
  - Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks
  - Gated recurrent unit (GRU)
  - Convolution networks
