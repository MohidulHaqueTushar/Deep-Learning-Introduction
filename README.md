This repositiry introduces some concepts of deep learning to tackle time series data. A time series is a set of observations taken sequentially in time. The most common type of time series where we have observations coming in at regular intervals of time is called regular time series.
 
Have the following two main sections:
  1. Deep Learning foundations
  2. Core concepts of deep learning for time series
