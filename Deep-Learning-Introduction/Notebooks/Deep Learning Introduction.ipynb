    "This is an array of numbers. If we plot this point in the two-dimensional **coordinate space**, we get a point. And if we draw a line from the origin to this point, we will get an entity with direction and magnitude. This is a vector. A two-dimensional vector space, informally, is all the possible vectors with two entries.This two-dimensional coordinate space is called a vector space.\n",

    "### Matrices and transformations\n",
    "Genarally a matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers. Matrix specifies a linear transformation of the vector space it resides in.We multiply a vector with a matrix, we are essentially transforming the vector, and the values and dimensions of the matrix define the kind of transformation that happens. We also apply these transformation matrices to vector spaces to develop intuition on how matrix multiplication can rotate and warp the vector spaces.\n",

    "Deep learning is not just one model, but rather a language to express any model in terms of a few parametrized modules with these specific properties:\n",
    "- Able to produce an output from a given input through a series of computations.\n",
    "- If the desired output is given, they should be able to pass on information to its inputs on how to change, to arrive at the  desired output. For instance, if the output is lower than what is desired, the module should be able to tell its inputs to change in some direction so that the output becomes closer to the desired one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize these kinds of systems, we predominantly use gradient-based optimization methods. Therefore, condensing the two properties into one, we can say that these parameterized modules should be differentiable functions\n",

    "Deep learning can be thought of as a system that takes in raw input data through a series of linear and non-linear transforms to provide us with an output. It also can adjust its internal parameters to make the output as close as possible to the desired output through learning.\n",
