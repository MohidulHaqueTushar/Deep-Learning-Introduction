# Deep-Learning-Introduction

This is a general introduction of deep learning in context of Time Series data. Main learning points can be divided into the following sections:
- Defination of deep learning
- Necessay of deep learning in today's world
- Components of a deep learning system
- Representation learning
- Linear layers
- Activation functions
- Gradient descent

Two main reasons why deep learning has gained a lot of ground in the last two decades:

- Computational availability: the introduction of GPUs provided the much-needed boost to the widespread use of deep learning and accelerated the progress in the field. <br>

- Data availability: if we keep increasing the data that we provide to a deep learning model, the model will be able to learn better and better functions. with more data, deep learning starts to outperform traditional machine learning.
