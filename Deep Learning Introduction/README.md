# Deep-Learning-Introduction

This is a general introduction of deep learning in context of Time Series data. Main learning points can be divided into the following sections:
- Defination of deep learning
- Necessay of deep learning in today's world
- Components of a deep learning system
- Representation learning
- Linear layers
- Activation functions
- Gradient descent

Two main reasons why deep learning has gained a lot of ground in the last two decades:

- Computational availability: the introduction of GPUs provided the much-needed boost to the widespread use of deep learning and accelerated the progress in the field. <br>

- Data availability: if we keep increasing the data that we provide to a deep learning model, the model will be able to learn better and better functions. with more data, deep learning starts to outperform traditional machine learning.
  
Deep learning versus traditional machine learning as we increase the data size:
